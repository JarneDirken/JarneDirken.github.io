                                    ideas and business
                                    processes.
                                    Management skills and strong team building abilities are often perceived as
                                    essential
                                    leadership
                                    attributes for successful entrepreneurs. Political economist Robert Reich considers
                                    leadership,
                                    management ability and team-building to be essential qualities of an entrepreneur.

                                <p class="p1">The term "entrepreneur" is often conflated with the term "small business"
                                    or used
                                    interchangeably
                                    with this term. While most entrepreneurial ventures start out as a small business,
                                    not

                                    businesses are entrepreneurial in the strict sense of the term. Many small
                                    businesses
                                    are

                                    employees—and
                                    many of these small businesses offer an existing product, process or service and

                                    the entrepreneur typically aims to scale up the company by adding employees, seeking

                                    sales and so on, a process which is financed by venture capital and angel

                                    economist Richard Cantillon, which was foundational to classical economics.
                                    Cantillon
                                    defined
                                    the

                                    Cantillon
                                    defined the term as a person who pays a certain price for a product and resells it
                                    at an

                                    deliberately
                                    allocates resources to exploit opportunities to maximize the financial return.
                                    Cantillon
                                    emphasized
                                    the willingness of the entrepreneur to assume the risk and to deal with uncertainty,

                                <p id="swap2">A startup or start-up is a company or project undertaken by an entrepreneur to seek,
                                    develop, and validate a scalable business model. While entrepreneurship refers to
                                    all new businesses, including self-employment and businesses that never intend to
                                    become registered, startups refer to new businesses that intend to grow large beyond
                                    the solo founder. At the beginning, startups face high uncertainty and have high
                                    rates of failure, but a minority of them do go on to be successful and influential.
                                    Some startups become unicorns; that is privately held startup companies valued at
                                    over US$1 billion. </p>
